# Project

This is a p5.js interactive game where the user must direct a circle all the way to the top of the Canvas without bumping into two floating circles. The two floating circles move fast, so the user can click his/her mouse in order to change the size of the circles. If the user's ellipse hits the top/bottom, it is worth one point. Scoring 5 points will win the game. If the user bumps into the floating circles, the game restarts and they lose their points. The background changes based off of the quadrant the user's ellipse is in, which is meant to throw the user off. Similarily, if a user decides to press their mouse, the circles will not only change in size, but also colour (for the same purpose). 

This was based off of another idea  for a project based on rockets and asteroids, but as my coding knowledge is limited, I decided to make a simpler version.
